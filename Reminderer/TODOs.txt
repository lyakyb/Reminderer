Update when loading tasks
- schedules that need reminder on
- Reminders are all off by default except for daily reminders (so for every interval it would start firing as soon as user turns it on)
- Check date to see if notification is needed
1.reminders on repeat 2.schedules with notification on 3. Reminders with interval repeat

On Edit(UPDAtE) delete timer and pretend to have added a new task

Update text message for desired date time depending on reminder type (ex. Repeats every h:m, will notify at (or countdown textblock), repeats at h:m on xyz days), etc. maybe add a bell icon for reminders with notification on

Maybe move edit from double click to right click for reminders, and make double click to turn on/off notifications (look at timer .change)
- rmdrmngr should have turn notificationOn/OffForTask

After all this system tray icon minimize => context menu to quit.
Then find a way to make it an exe or just archive it as a zip lol

Very future stuff:
Notification animation
Notification location setting
Just make UI look nicer
​



6. Make application not shutdown but minimize to an icon 
7. add right mouse click options on the icon (Open/Exit)
