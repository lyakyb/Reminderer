Work on unit testing until either lol or 3pm after lunch
- Mock data service
- Db/notification stuff first
- Ui check (ui values and task values mapped properly)l
​

Maybe move edit from double click to right click for reminders, and make double click to turn on/off notifications (look at timer .change)
- rmdrmngr should have turn notificationOn/OffForTask

After all this system tray icon minimize => context menu to quit.
Then find a way to make it an exe or just archive it as a zip lol

Very future stuff:
Notification animation
Notification location setting
Just make UI look nicer
​



6. Make application not shutdown but minimize to an icon 
7. add right mouse click options on the icon (Open/Exit)
